this is still a WIP project

what i want to do is making a sudoku solver for like sudoku.com or another sudoku web or application.

my algorithm plan is, 

1. (Still Learning / WIP) Scan a screen where there is a sudoku board with the numbers, option 2 is scan a screenshoted screen where there is a sudoku board inside

2. (WIP) Put all the numbers data into a txt files

3. (DONE) Read the txt files and solve the sudoku using backtracking algorithm

4. (DONE) Put the solved data to a second txt file

5. (DONE) Make another program then read the txt files and autoprint it on the sudoku board using keyboard library (py)


**If anyone can help me to do the WIP things pls show me (dm dc Hikarei#7661), or if u know the faster method**
